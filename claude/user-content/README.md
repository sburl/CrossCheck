# Content (Human-Only Zone)

This directory contains human-authored content that agents must **never** modify.

## Rules

- Agents may **read** files here for context
- Agents must **never** edit, delete, move, or reorganize files here
- This is enforced via CLAUDE.md convention

## What Goes Here

- User-submitted content
- Editorial decisions and notes
- Human-authored copy, blog drafts, design docs
- Anything where the human voice matters

## Why

Not everything should be AI-generated. This boundary preserves human
artifacts as AI capabilities grow. The agent is a tool, not an author
for everything.
